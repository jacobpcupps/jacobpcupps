# Welcome!

I'm still at the novice stage of learning about git and github, but I'm at a point where I use it 
frequently enough that I thought I'd spend some time on some boiler-plate things for anyone whose 
poking around my account. For those who don't know me personally, hi---my name is Jacob, I study 
music theory, and I have just recently got into using my computer as a meaningful tool for 
dealing with that. Most of my respositories are writing projects I've developed during my master's 
program, which I've written in TeX and imported to GitHub via Overleaf.

I'll sign off with a poem I like, "Logic" from Richard Siken's *War of The Foxes*:

> A clock is a machine. A gear is a tool. There is rarely
> any joy in a frictionless place, so find your inner viscosity.
> The mind says viscosity is resistance to flow. The body
> puts glue on a twig and catches a bird. Glue is a tool,
> unless you are a bird. If you are a bird, then glue is
> an inconvenience. A tool does work. A bird flies away
> from danger and lands where it can. All thinking is
> comparison. A bear is a weapon, a bear claw is a pastry.
> A bear trap, if you are a bear, is an inconvenience.
> Logic is boring because it works. Being unreasonable
> is exciting. Machines have knobs you can turn if you
> want to. A hammer is a hammer when it hits the nail.
> A hammer is not a hammer when it's sleeping. I woke
> up tired of being the hammer. There's a dream in the
> space in between the hammer and nail: the dream of
> about-to-be-hit, which is a bad dream, but the nail will
> take the hit if it gets to sleep inside the wood forever.
> I taped a sword to my hand when I was younger. This
> is an argument about goals.
